ATTRIBUTES
- changes in entity.js to change the attribute modifiers to SWN system


todo: 
Delete the one on the other side - is it a save mod? idk




SKILLS
1. Change Skill Names in en.json, config.js. Also add work to each of those + template.json.
todo: 
- change font of skills so they all fit (i added just 1), 
- detatch skills from attributes, 
- change the attribute reference in skills to a text box (it can be small, just 1-9 so no 2 digit size). 
To do this, I suggest just changing the character sheet size to be a little taller, otherwise make the font like 1 smaller.
- make a roll button (if time) to let players choose what trait they want to roll with and then roll.

notes: Skills currently do not use the expected names in the code. So Administer will really be from 5e acrobatics.


HEADER

todo: 
- replace race with class and level
- Remove alignment to make more space for class/level (may have to manipulate css a bit here too)

COUNTERS (death saves, system strain, etc in that part of the sheet)
- character-sheet.html
- I took out death saves and inspiration (comment out)
- replaced exhaustion with system strain. The term ONLY. The other stuff having to do with exhaustion still happens behind the
scenes and is taking up space, and system strain isn't automatically affected by anything other than this input box. 
- template.js - removed and replaced some senses. Blindsight replaced with heatvision. This will leave some db items hanging, 
since I haven't changed those at all.
-config.js and en.json is where you change the names of things. I'm changing/adding/removing languages here
-config.js same as above for damage types. Bludg,pierc,slash -> physical. Fire->heat. force, necrotic, non-magical phsyical,
poison, radiant, thunder removed. Again, this will leave db files hanging. 

todo:
- add sizes for npcs only as a selector. If not, I could just turn the size into a text box instead.ss
