# About

This sheet is for Stars Without Number: Revised edition. 
This sheet has originally been made for personal use. As such, a couple things - like certain item qualities (like tech level) are not included. Though, these can be included in the item description (If there is demand, I may change these to suit more people). Since this is unofficial, and not directly part of Foundry, to install the system, just download and extract the code. Then, drop it into the 'systems' folder in your Foundry directory. From there, you should be able to update it as you would any other system and it should show up on the systems you have installed. 

# Why This Sheet?

Pros | Cons
------------ | -------------
Aesthetically pleasing | No ships
Most stats are automated (AC, strain, etc) | No compendiums
Familiar for 5e sheet users
Front page space for notes



# Compatability
Since this is mostly based off of the 5e character sheet, some of those modules should still work with stuff that hasn't been changed. Stuff like token modules, map modules, and chat modules should work. 
For example, Crash's autohide rolls will work after a few adjustments.


# Possible Additions
- Vehicles
- Ships
- Global modifiers, like melee attack bonus, shock damage, or encumbrance bonus. For both characters and NPCs
- Compendiums
- Remove unused files and code
