# About

This sheet is for Stars Without Number: Revised edition. 
Since I homebrew a lot of my own content for my own games, I may not add features I don't use - like item compendiums - unless there is significant interest in me doing so.

Most stats are automated (AC, strain, etc) | No compendiums
Familiar for 5e sheet users
Front page space for notes

# Contact
If you have any other feedback, be it suggestions or support, send me a message on discord - lofty#8637, or an email at kvrosevelt@gmail.com. If people are enjoying it, I'll have more reason to add features.

# Compatability
Since this is mostly based off of the 5e character sheet, many of the modules compatible with that should require minimal changes to function here. Stuff like token modules, map modules, and chat modules should work. 
For example, Crash's autohide rolls work after a few adjustments (I can share my changes if needed).


# Possible Additions
- Vehicles
- Ships
- Global modifiers, like melee attack bonus, shock damage, or encumbrance bonus. For both characters and NPCs
- Compendiums
- Remove unused files and code
