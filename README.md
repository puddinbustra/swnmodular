If you have any other feedback, be it suggestions or support, send me a message on discord - lofty#8637, or an email at kvrosevelt@gmail.com. Seriously, if you like the sheet, let me know somehow. If people are enjoying it, I'll see more reason to add features. If you don't like something, I'll still consider your feedback.

# Why This Sheet?

Pros | Cons
------------ | -------------
Aesthetically pleasing | No ships
Most stats are automated (AC, strain, etc) | No compendiums
Familiar for 5e sheet users
Front page space for notes



# Compatability
Since this is mostly based off of the 5e character sheet, some of those modules should still work with stuff that hasn't been changed. Stuff like token modules, map modules, and chat modules should work. 



# Possible Additions
- Vehicles
- Ships
- Global modifiers, like melee attack bonus, or encumbrance bonus
- Compendiums
