# Why This Sheet?

Pros | Cons
------------ | -------------
Aesthetically pleasing | No ships
Most stats are automated (AC, strain, etc) | No compendiums
Familiar for 5e sheet users
Front page space for notes


# Compatability
Since this is mostly based off of the 5e character sheet, so some of those modules should still work with stuff that hasn't been changed. Stuff like token modules, map modules, and chat modules should work. 


# Things That Could Be Added
- Vehicles
- Ships
- Global modifiers, like melee attack bonus, or encumbrance bonus
