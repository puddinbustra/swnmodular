# About

This sheet is for Stars Without Number: Revised edition. 
Since I homebrew a lot of my own content for my own games, I may not add features I don't use - like item compendiums - unless there is significant interest in me doing so.

# Why This Sheet?

Pros | Cons
------------ | -------------
Aesthetically pleasing | No ships
Most stats are automated (AC, strain, etc) | No compendiums
Familiar for 5e sheet users
Front page space for notes


# Support

# Compatability
Since this is mostly based off of the 5e character sheet, some of those modules should still work with stuff that hasn't been changed. Stuff like token modules, map modules, and chat modules should work. 
For example, Crash's autohide rolls will work after a few adjustments.


# Possible Additions
- Vehicles
- Ships
- Global modifiers, like melee attack bonus, shock damage, or encumbrance bonus. For both characters and NPCs
- Compendiums
- Remove unused files and code
