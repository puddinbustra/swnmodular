The purpose of this sheet is intended for my own use, and currently includes my own homebrew. I shouldn't have too much trouble adding a standard, non-homebrew character. 
But, it's enough work that I'd like to make sure people would use it before I invest more time in making it. If you really want it though, a donation could motivate me to work on it.
If you have any other feedback, be it suggestions or support, send me a message on discord - lofty#8637.

# Compatability

Since this is mostly based off of the 5e character sheet, so some of those modules should still work with stuff that hasn't been changed. 
But it will surely not work with stuff I have changed: 

- Specific skills (general ability modifiers and stuff should still work)
- Character sheet layout
- Magic and spells in general
- Specific items
- Action types

# Things That Could Be Added
- Vehicle type
- Ship Type
-
